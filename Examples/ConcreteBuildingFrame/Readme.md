The concrete building frame example is a full-scale test structure in the Structural Engineering and Materials Laboratory on the Georgia Tech campus. Model updating is performed entirely through simulation models. Detailed descriptions of the structure and model updating studies can be found in the companion monograph, ["Formulation and application of SMU - an open-source MATLAB package for structural model updating."](https://github.com/ywang-structures/Structural-Model-Updating/blob/master/Formulation%20and%20application%20of%20SMU%20%E2%80%93%20an%20open-source%20MATLAB%20package%20for%20structural%20model%20updating.pdf)
